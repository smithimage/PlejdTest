# PlejdTest
A small test project

TODO
Implement RangeSliderView class. The slider should have a knob for the selected minimum and a knob for the selected 
maximum. There is no requirement for it to be implemented in forms, but can instead be implemented with renderers in
one of the platforms Android or iOS. Place the new slider somewhere in the TestPage or replace the old slider.

The TestPage has a few buttons which can be used to verify the functionality of the range slider. There are no direct
requirements on the appearance of the knob of the slider, but can be implemented with custom png files alternatively 
just use simple programmed views which ever you prefer.
